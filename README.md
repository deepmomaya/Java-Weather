# Java-Weather

In this project, I have built a Java based weather application offering real-time weather updates for any location. Leveraging Java's robustness and platform independence, the application provides an intuitive graphical user interface for easy interaction. Users can access detailed weather information including temperature, humidity, and wind speed by simply entering the desired location in the search field. With its lightweight and easy-to-read format, JSON enables smooth communication with external APIs, facilitating the quick retrieval of real-time weather data.
